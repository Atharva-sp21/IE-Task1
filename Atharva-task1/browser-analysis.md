Browser DevTools Analysis
1. HTTP vs HTTPS Comparison



Websites tested:

    http://neverssl.com (HTTP)
    https://github.com (HTTPS)
    https://youtube.com (HTTPS)

*Wireshark*
-> Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, a tool that lets you capture, inspect and analyze data that travels through websites
**Observations**

HTTP (http://neverssl.com)
- It add data in plain text

HTTPS(https://github.com & https://youtube.com)
- It transfers data but with an additional security layer (TLS-Transport Layer Security) which encrypts the data between your browser and website

**Why HTTPS is more secure:**
HTTPS uses TLS encryption, which ensures data is unreadable to attackers, verifies the websiteâ€™s identity (via certificates), and prevents tampering.

Which made the most requests and why?
YouTube made the most requests because it loads multiple scripts, ads, thumbnails, and video-related assets dynamically.

Timing Phases (example from GitHub main request):

*DNS Lookup*: Time to resolve github.com to IP
*Connection Time*: Time to open TCP + TLS handshake
*Waiting (TTFB)*: Time until first byte from server (server processing)

Insight:
The more resources (scripts, images) a site loads, the more requests and latency it introduces.
