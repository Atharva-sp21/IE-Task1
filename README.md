README

This repo has my networking and blockchain projects. I have a growing interest in how networks and blockchains work together — how data moves, how security is kept, and how systems connect without trust.

I worked on browser and Wireshark analysis, packet tracing, DNS & DHCP simulator, and a simple blockchain smart contract project. These helped me understand both network flow and decentralized systems.

In Task 3 (Smart Contract project), I finished till Part B but couldn’t complete Part C and D yet. I plan to dig deeper and finish them soon as I learn more about deployment and contract testing.

Tech Stack: Python, Solidity, Hardhat, Node.js, MetaMask, Wireshark, VS Code
